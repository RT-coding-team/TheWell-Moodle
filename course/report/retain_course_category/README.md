# Retain Course Category

This plugin allows users to backup and restore the category that the course is assigned to.  So when they backup the course, it will automatically save the category as well.  When the course is restored, it will add the category and assign it to the course.

## Why a Course Report?

We want the data to be in the course/course.xml file of the backup archive.  If you use a local plugin, it adds the XML data into every resource.
